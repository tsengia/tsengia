:wave: Hello! Welcome to my GitHub profile.  
:heart: I've been writing software for years.  
:pencil: I speak many lanuages including Go, Python, Rust, C, C++, Bash, Java, JavaScript, and SQL.

:running: Here are some things that might be of use to you:
- [py-ujlaser](https://github.com/Student-Space-Programs-Laboratory/py-ujlaser) - A Python library for controlling Quantum Composers MicroJewel lasers.
- [Web Piano](https://piano-app.tsengia.net/) - A web-based virtual piano. Built using MIDI.JS and Vue 2.
- [Bash1602Driver](https://github.com/tsengia/Bash1602Driver) - A program to control a 16x2 LCD on a Raspberry Pi 1, Model B. Written in pure Bash because why not?

:book: I am currently learning more about AWS, TypeScript, and Go.

# README: Tyler Sengia
:wave: Hello! Welcome to my GitHub profile.  
:heart: Writing software has been my passion for years, and I consider myself to be both a generalist and a specialist.  
:pencil: I speak many lanuages; my favorites are Python, C++, and JavaScript.  

:running: Here are some things that might be of use to you:
- [py-ujlaser](https://github.com/Student-Space-Programs-Laboratory/py-ujlaser) - A Python library for controlling Quantum Composers MicroJewel lasers.
- [JSGFKit++](https://github.com/tsengia/JSGFKit_Plus_Plus) - A C++ library for programmatically manipulating [Java Speech Grammar Format](https://www.w3.org/TR/2000/NOTE-jsgf-20000605/) files
- [DBusBlocks](https://github.com/tsengia/DBusBlocks) - A block based environment to build DBus introspection files, built with [Google Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/)
- [Bash1602Driver](https://github.com/tsengia/Bash1602Driver) - A program to control a 16x2 LCD on a Raspberry Pi 1, Model B. Written in pure Bash because why not?

:book: I am currently learning more about AWS, TypeScript, and Rust.

:star: Things I find interesting:
- [Typia](https://typia.io/) - A TypeScript transformer that enables parsing TypeScript classes from JSON documents.
- [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) - An OS built on top of a functional package manager. Take a look at this [blog post by Flying Circus](https://flyingcircus.io/blog/thoughts-on-systems-management-methods/)<sub>[archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20230705043418/https://flyingcircus.io/blog/thoughts-on-systems-management-methods/)</sub> for why I find it interesting.
- [seL4](https://sel4.systems/) - A formally verified microkernel developed for high-reliability use cases.

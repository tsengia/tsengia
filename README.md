# README: Tyler Sengia
:wave: Hello! Welcome to my GitHub profile.  
:heart: Writing software has been my passion for years, and my interests vary widely.  
:pencil: I speak many lanuages, but my favorites are Python, C++, and JavaScript.  
:duck: Don't underestimate my Java, SQL, and Bash abilities! I consider myself to be proficient in those too.  

:question: If you are a recruiter, I recommend you take a look at my personal website [tsengia.net](https://tsengia.net), and look through my GitHub repositories.

:running: If you're someone casually browsing, here are some things that might be of use to you:
- [py-ujlaser](https://github.com/Student-Space-Programs-Laboratory/py-ujlaser) - A Python library for controlling Quantum Composers MicroJewel lasers.
- [JSGFKit++](https://github.com/tsengia/JSGFKit_Plus_Plus) - A C++ library for programmatically manipulating [Java Speech Grammar Format](https://www.w3.org/TR/2000/NOTE-jsgf-20000605/) files
- [DBusBlocks](https://github.com/tsengia/DBusBlocks) - A block based environment to build DBus introspection files, built with [Google Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/)
- [Bash1602Driver](https://github.com/tsengia/Bash1602Driver) - A program to control a 16x2 LCD on a Raspberry Pi 1, Model B. Written in pure Bash because I am crazy.

:book: I am currently learning more about AWS. I've recently become an AWS certified Cloud Practitioner, and I'm thinking about pursuing another certification next.  

:star: Things I find interesting:
- [Deno](https://deno.land/) - A "replacement" for NodeJS with first class support for TypeScript.
- [seL4](https://sel4.systems/) - A formally verified microkernel developed for high-reliability use cases.
- [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) - An OS built on top of a functional package manager. Please take a look at this [blog post by Fly Circus](https://flyingcircus.io/blog/thoughts-on-systems-management-methods/) too.
- [Graph Neural Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_neural_network) - Neural networks that work with graph-like data structures.
